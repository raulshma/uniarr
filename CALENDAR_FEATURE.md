## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```tsx
import { useCalendar } from '@/hooks/useCalendar';
import { CalendarHeader, CalendarMonthView } from '@/components/calendar';

function CalendarScreen() {
  const {
    state,
    calendarData,
    stats,
    navigation,
    setView,
    setSelectedDate,
  } = useCalendar();

  return (
    <View>
      <CalendarHeader
        navigation={navigation}
        view={state.view}
        onViewChange={setView}
      />
      <CalendarMonthView
        data={calendarData}
        selectedDate={state.selectedDate}
        onDateSelect={setSelectedDate}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Adding Custom Filters

```tsx
const { setFilters, clearFilters } = useCalendar();

// Set custom filters
setFilters({
  mediaTypes: ['movie'],
  statuses: ['upcoming'],
  searchQuery: 'Marvel',
});

// Clear all filters
clearFilters();
```

### Handling Release Press Events

```tsx
const handleReleasePress = (releaseId: string) => {
  // Navigate to release details
  router.push(`/release/${releaseId}`);
};

<CalendarMonthView
  data={calendarData}
  onReleasePress={handleReleasePress}
/>
```

## Data Integration

### Sonarr Integration
- Fetches series and episode data
- Includes next airing dates

## Error Handling

### Service Errors
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback to cached data when possible

### Data Validation
- Date string validation
- Type checking for all data structures
- Safe fallbacks for missing data
- Console warnings for invalid inputs

### UI Error States
- Loading states with skeleton placeholders
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Error boundaries for component isolation
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations

## Performance Optimizations

### Data Fetching
- React Query for caching and background updates
- Stale-while-revalidate strategy
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Request deduplication

### Rendering
- FlashList for efficient list rendering
- Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Virtual scrolling for performance

### Memory Management
- Proper cleanup of event listeners
- Efficient data structures
- Minimal re-renders through proper state management
- Garbage collection friendly patterns
